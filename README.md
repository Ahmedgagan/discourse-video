# discourse-video

discourse-video is a plugin that provides an improved video upload and playback experience using [Mux](https://mux.com/).

Features include:

 - Upload large videos in chunks
 - Play videos via streaming so that you don't have to download the whole video to watch
 - Automatic video encoding
 - Videos are stored externally by mux so that they don't take up space on your Discourse instance.
